	<h1>About me!</h1>
	<br>
	<h3><br>
		How'd I describe myself? Commited and resillient!
	<br>	
	<br>
		Once I've finished my superior education in 2009 I've found myself in the midst of a financial and economic crisis. I struggled to provide myself. I used the Internet potential to carry the momentum developed in college with a pioneer Master Thesis on a subject related to Environmental Economic Valuation, while participating in scientific prizes to improve my skills and my network.
	<br>
	<br>
		In 2010 my professional career had its major breaks with IFAP and Statistics Portugal. I have a 7 year working experience in the latter, 5 of them as Part of the Coordination Team for the Eurostat-OCDE Purchasing Power Parities Programme and 2 in the field of Environment.
	<br>
	<br>
		Currently I'm at the Secretary General for Environment in the Foresight and Planning Department, in the Team responsible for the management of the EEA Grants Project as Programme Operator for the Environment Programme.
	<br>
	<br>
		In 2020, with the pandemic I found other challenges, such as looking after my physical and mental health and developing other skills, such as Web Development with the Tech Career GPS promoted by CML and Le Wagon Portugal.
	<br>
	<br>
		My goals include developing my potential and increasing my network. I believe in teamwork since we all have something to learn from others.
	<br>
	<br>
		I love Sports, played football and futsal at competition level, but now I stick to my regular workout and running. I try my best to involve in social causes. I'm also an anime, book, series and movie addict.
	<br>
